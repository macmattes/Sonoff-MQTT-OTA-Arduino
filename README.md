## Sonoff-MQTT-OTA-Arduino
Provide ESP8266 based [itead Sonoff](https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-wifi-wireless-switch.html) with MQTT and 'Over the Air' or OTA firmware using Arduino IDE.

See [Sonoff-MQTT-OTA](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-MQTT-OTA) for the ```esp-open-sdk``` version.
## Prerequisite
Install the ESP8266 Arduino development environment from [esp8266 Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino). The software is tested on a Windows PC with Arduino IDE versions 1.6.5r5, 1.6.8 and 1.6.9 and esp8266 Arduino versions 2.1.0, 2.2.0 and 2.3.0.

- I prefer a standalone version of the IDE allowing easy ESP8266 file manipulation. This can be achieved by downloading the Arduino IDE ZIP file for non admin install. After unzipping and before executing ```arduino.exe``` add an empty directory called ```portable```
- Follow the procedure to install the ESP8266 Arduino development environment
- Copy the ```sonoff``` directory to your sketchfolder

Download and unzip the [pubsubclient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) MQTT library into directory ```portable\sketchbook\libraries```. Rename to pubsubclient and update default values in file ```pubsubclient\src\PubSubClient.h```
- Change MQTT_MAX_PACKET_SIZE from 128 to 1024
- Change MQTT_KEEPALIVE from 15 to 120

Install php and a local web server (ie apache) for OTA and copy directory ```api``` in webroot.

If you want to be able to upload the OTA file from the IDE to your webserver perform the following changes to the Arduino IDE environment:

- Copy file ```espupload.py``` to directory ```portable\packages\esp8266\hardware\esp8266\2.3.0\tools```
- Replace files ```boards.txt``` and ```platform.txt``` in directory ```portable\packages\esp8266\hardware\esp8266\2.3.0```

This will provide an additional option ```Tools - Upload Using: OTA_upload```.
## Compile and upload
For sonoff select from ```Tools Board Generic ESP8266 Module``` and set the following options:

- Flash Mode: QIO
- Flash Frequency: 40MHz
- Upload Using: Serial
- CPU Frequency: 80MHz
- Flash Size: 1M (64K SPIFFS)
- Debug Port: Disabled
- Debug Level: None
- Reset Method: ck
- Upload Speed: 115200
- Port: Your COM port connected to sonoff

Update ```sonoff.ino``` with your specific Wifi and MQTT parameters.

Verify source and upload once to sonoff using the serial connection as shown in [Peter Scargill's blog](http://tech.scargill.net/itead-slampher-and-sonoff). 
<img alt="Connection diagram" src="https://github.com/arendst/arendst.github.io/blob/master/media/ProgramESP8266.jpg" height="260" /> 

**Do not connect AC power during the flash cable connection**. 

Verify and upload an OTA image to your web server with option ```Upload Using: OTA_upload```.

Enable debug messages by selecting option Tools Debug Port: Serial.
## Usage
The button on sonoff provides the following features:

- a short press toggles the relay either by sending a MQTT message like ```cmnd/sonoff/light 2``` or directly. This will blink the LED twice and sends a MQTT status message like ```stat/sonoff/LIGHT on```
- two short presses toggles the relay. This will blink the LED twice and sends a MQTT status message like ```stat/sonoff/POWER on```
- three short presses start Wifi smartconfig which allows for SSID and Password configuration using an Android mobile phone with the [ESP8266 SmartConfig](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmmakerclub.iot.esptouch) app. The green LED will blink during the smartconfig period for 100 seconds. The MQTT server still needs to be configured using the ```user_config.h``` file
- four short presses start OTA download of firmware. The green LED is lit during the update
- five short presses will restart sonoff
- pressing the button for over four seconds resets settings to defaults as defined in ```user_config.h``` and reboots  sonoff

Sonoff responds to the following MQTT commands:

- the relay can be controlled by ```cmnd/sonoff/power on```, ```cmns/sonoff/power off``` or ```cmnd/sonoff/power toggle```. The LED will blink twice and sends a MQTT status message like ```stat/sonoff/POWER on```. The same function can be initiated with ```cmnd/sonoff/light on```
- the MQTT topic can be changed with ```cmnd/sonoff/topic sonoff1``` which reboots sonoff and makes it available for MQTT commands like ```cmnd/sonoff1/power on```
- the OTA firmware location can be made known to sonoff by ```cmnd/sonoff/otaurl http://sidnas2:80/api/sonoff/user1.bin``` where sidnas2 is your webserver hosting the firmware. Reset to default with ```cmnd/sonoff/otaurl 1```
- upgrade OTA firmware by ```cmnd/sonoff/upgrade 1```
- show status information by ```cmnd/sonoff/status 1```

Most MQTT commands will result in a status feedback like ```stat/sonoff/POWER On```.
## Commands supported
The firmware supports both a **serial** and a **MQTT** Man Machine interface. The serial interface is set to 115200 bps. The MQTT commands are constructed as ```cmnd/sonoff/<command>```. 

The following commands are recognised by both topic and grouptopic:

If the same topic has been defined to more than one sonoff an individual sonoff can still be addressed by the fall back topic MQTT_CLIENT_ID as defined in user_config.h. The fall back topic will be ```DVES_<last six characters of MAC address>```.
## Tips
- To aid in finding the IP address of sonoff the network name will be ```esp-<last six characters of MAC address>-<MQTT topic>```. So the default name is ```esp-123456-sonoff```. Another option is MQTT command status 5.
- Use the group topic to address several sonoffs with one (restricted) MQTT command.

## Modified kaku power socket switch using ESP-12F
Using parts from itead (5V power supply), aliexpress (Different 5V power supply, ESP-12F and 5V to 3V3 step down) and ebay (5V relay) I modified broken 434MHz kaku power socket switches type PAR-1000 to Wifi wkaku power socket switches.
